I build web apps that solve you and your grandma's problems. I currently develop within the Javascript ecosystem which includes React, NodeJS and GraphQL. I love playing with new technologies so be sure to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/Beznet) for my most recent projects. Other than that you can find me either [taking photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/141245432@N06/) , playing some dated game that no one likes anymore or reading the same Brandon Sanderson novel for 5 years. If you'd like to get in touch please send me an email below.
