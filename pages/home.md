I build software that solves you and your grandma's problems! I have extensive experience with React and building robust backend services with Go, Rails and NodeJS.

I also enjoy playing with new [tech](https://github.com/Beznet), [taking photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/141245432@N06/), drawing spooky creatures or playing and organizing [competitive pinball events](https://www.ifpapinball.com/players/view.php?p=94797)

If you want to get in touch feel free to send me an email!
