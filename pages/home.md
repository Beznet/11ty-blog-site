I build software that solve you and your grandma's problems! I love playing with new tech so be sure to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/Beznet) for my most recent projects. Otherwise, you can also find me either [taking photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/141245432@N06/) , drawing spooky creatures or playing and organizing [competitive pinball events](https://www.ifpapinball.com/players/view.php?p=94797) (yes, compoeitive pinball is a thing).

If you want to get in touch feel free to send me an email!
