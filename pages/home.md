# Hello

I help build web apps that solve you and your grandma's problems. I currently develop within the Javascript ecosystem which includes React, NodeJS and GraphQL. I love playing with new technologies so be sure to check out my GitHub for my most recent projects. Other than that you can find me either [taking photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/141245432@N06/) or playing some dated game that no one likes anymore. Did I answer everything? If not be sure to hit that button below to get in contact with me!
