I build web apps that solve you and your grandma's problems! I currently develop within the Javascript ecosystem which includes React and NodeJS. I love playing with new technologies so be sure to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/Beznet) for my most recent projects. Otherwise, you can also find me either [taking photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/141245432@N06/) , drawing spooky creatures, writing a tech piece on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/beznet/) or reading the same Brandon Sanderson novel for 5 years.

If you have any questions feel free to shoot me an email:
