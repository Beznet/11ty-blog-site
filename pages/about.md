Hey there, my name is Bennett Dungan and I am a self-taught web developer with a degree in Economics and a love for outdoor photography. I created this blog to help other people along their coding journey and just as another medium to share my thoughts. I currently reside in the swampy south with a loving girlfriend and our tail-less cat, Nugget.
