<p>After writing up my last tutorial, I started toying with the idea that creating a Youtube tutorial might be a bit quicker and easier way to approach coding tutorials. Written tutorials have their place but it honestly took me a lot longer to create than I anticipated. Personally, I learn a bit better through video tutorials anyways because watching someone's flow just gives a bit better depth in understanding how to do something. I'm mostly doing this as a way for me to get better at certain areas of coding. Since teaching something requires a very solid grasp of the concepts, it'll force me to learn something inside and out. I also think that if you figure something out that isn't well documented on the web then it's sort of a good way to give back to the community by showing your solution to the problem. Anyways, here's a link to the intro video:</p>
