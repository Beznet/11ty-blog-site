It's been awhile. I promise my absence has been for good reason though, not because I fell off the coding wagon. Actually, quite the opposite. As the title says, I got a freakin' job as a web application developer! I was hired on back in September and have been there for about 3 months now. Since then coding has been apart of my daily life more than ever before so my blog updates have sort of taken a back seat. 

I do apologize about the long hiatus though. From the interviewing process (which was quite brutal for someone of my novice skill level) to the job itself , life has been super draining. Don't get me wrong, I'm learning loads of stuff each and every day but I now know this is where the real journey starts. Getting the job was just the beginning.

I definitely intend to give a full recap about the interview, personal struggles, how I overcame certain obstacles and ultimately landed the job but in the mean time I wanted to let everyone know that I'm alive and doing well. Until next time, happy coding!
